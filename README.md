# INTRANETS
An intranet is like an internal internet for employees, helping them work better together while keeping everything secure and organized.
# why should IniTec consider an Intranet 
security = it is private and restricted to employees only.

efficiency = It stores all company resources, documents, and tools in one place.

communication = An intranet can provide a space for announcements, forums, or team messaging.

In short, an intranet is like a "private version of the internet" that helps employees work better together.
